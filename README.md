## Description

There is a calculator on bash. This is a Proof of Concept.

## How it works.

In order to use it, you should clone a project and run the script:

```
./calculator.sh
```

It will ask to enter expression. You can use expressions like: ```(12-5)*4-3-2*(5-2)```
Calculator can work with float as well as with integer.

## TODO

- Expand this decription.
- move main logic to the functions
